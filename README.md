# Datahaven

This repo is meant as a data source for information about Gloomhaven content.
For now this is pretty much just a raw dump of the data from the TTS mod of Gloomhaven with lots of information that is only needed for TTS itself.

The plan is to improve and generalize the data format in the future and to provide actual type information for them, so they can be reused for different tools.

## Spoiler Warning
Obvious spoiler warning for Gloomhaven as this contains information about all enemies, scenarios and locked envelopes, including Envelope X.
